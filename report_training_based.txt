Title: Fine-Tuning a Pretrained ResNet-18 Model on CIFAR-10

1. Objective
The objective of this experiment is to fine-tune a pretrained ResNet-18 model on the CIFAR-10 dataset in order to study the effectiveness of transfer learning in image classification tasks.

2. Dataset Description
The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 color images of size 32×32 pixels divided into 10 different classes. The dataset contains 50,000 training images and 10,000 testing images. All images were normalized before training.

3. Model Description
In this experiment, the ResNet-18 model pretrained on the ImageNet dataset was used. The pretrained model already contains learned low-level and mid-level image features. The final fully connected layer of the model was modified to output 10 classes corresponding to the CIFAR-10 dataset.

4. Methodology
The following steps were performed:
- Imported required PyTorch and torchvision libraries.
- Loaded the CIFAR-10 dataset using torchvision.
- Applied normalization to the images.
- Loaded the pretrained ResNet-18 model.
- Modified the final fully connected layer.
- Trained the model using backpropagation.
- Evaluated the model on test data.

5. Training Details
Loss Function: Cross Entropy Loss  
Optimizer: Adam  
Learning Rate: 0.001  
Batch Size: 64  
Number of Epochs: 10  

6. Results
The model showed steady improvement in training accuracy over epochs. The use of pretrained weights allowed faster convergence and better performance compared to training a model from scratch.

7. Analysis
Transfer learning enabled the model to reuse learned visual features such as edges and shapes. This reduced training time and improved accuracy on the CIFAR-10 dataset.

8. Limitations and Failure Cases
Some misclassifications occurred between visually similar classes such as cats and dogs, indicating overlapping visual features.

9. Conclusion
The experiment demonstrates that fine-tuning a pretrained ResNet-18 model significantly improves classification performance and training efficiency. Transfer learning proves to be an effective approach for image classification tasks with limited data.
